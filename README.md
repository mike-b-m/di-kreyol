# Di-Kreyol

**Di-Kreyol** is a simple, user-friendly web application that provides **word definitions in Haitian Creole**.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

This project was created to address a major gap in online language tools for Haitian Creole speakers. While translators exist, there is a lack of **definition-based dictionaries** specifically for native speakers. Di-Kreyol aims to fill that gap by offering a platform where users can find clear, contextual definitions in their own language.

## 🌍 Target Audience

- Native Haitian Creole speakers
- Students and educators in Haiti
- Anyone interested in understanding Creole vocabulary and meanings

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React-based framework for web development
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Cloud Database** – Used to store and manage Haitian Creole word definitions (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
